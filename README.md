# SCPlayer - Spotify Connect Player
Open source client of Spotify Connect closed library developed in Java

I decided to make a Java version because i needed the player to run without any privileged or any additional installation.<br/><br/>

This version is *working with Raspberry Pi 2* with the hard float version of the spotify's library<br/><br/>
There is a version to run in Raspberry Pi 1 <a href="https://github.com/crsmoro/scplayer/tree/armel" target="_blank">here</a>, but it only works in a soft float system (you will have to install Raspbian armel or emulate with chroot, docker, etc...). This version will only be updated after a while the main version.<br/><br/>
It's possible that it will be run other devices if you use the right version of spotify's library.<br/>

If you managed to run on others devices, or need help to, let me know.

Troubleshooting
----------------

If you are running on Openelec like I am, you have to run this command to enable alsa drivers<br/>
from ssh type `echo snd_bcm2835 >> /storage/.config/modules-load.d/audio.conf`<br/>
after version 6 you may also have to add `dtparam=audio=on` to config.txt<br/>
and reboot

If you are running on OSMC you have to run this command to enable alsa drivers<br/>
for older versions from ssh type `sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835` , no need to reboot<br/>
for newer versions add this line `dtparam=audio=on` to `/boot/config.txt`



Disclaimer
----------------
Using this code to connect to Spotify's API is probably forbidden by them, and might result in your application key getting banned. Use at you own risk
